# CodeMind  

> CodeMind is a recreation of the classic game Mastermind.  

The purpose of the game is to beat the codemaker by guessing the four color code within ten tries.  
 
After each round, the codemaker will randomly place a white or a red peg at the end of your code:
  - Red means that one of your colors is correct, and in the correct position.  
  - White means that you have a correct color, but it is in an incorrect position.  
  - Empty / black means that you have an incorrect color in your code.  

*NOTE:* The pegs are placed randomly and do not directly correspond to each successive color. You'll need to figure that out through trial and error.  

Every third round of the game, you will qualify for a Hint. They may or may not be useful...  

You win the game when you place your colors and the codemaker reveals four red pags, indicating that you have entered the correct color code.

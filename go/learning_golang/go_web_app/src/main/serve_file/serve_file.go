*****************
SUPER IMPORTANT
*****************
ROOT is determined by ...
WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR DIRECTORY WHEN YOU RUN "GO RUN"
wherever you are in your dir when you run "go run" - that's your root
for example
if this is your file structure
go_web_app
-- bin
-- pkg
-- src
---- main
------ main.go
-- templates
---- home.html
if you were in "go_web_app / src / main"
and you ran "go run main.go"
then the root of your files would be "go_web_app / src / main"
and you would not be able to access "templates" nor "templates/home.html"
if you were in "go_web_app"
and you ran "go run main.go"
then the root of your files would be "go_web_app"
and you would be able to access "templates" and "templates/home.html"
this is a good article - though advanced (so don't freak out if you're just getting started)

this can also be useful in debugging:
-- import "os"
---- log.Println("ENV: ", os.Environ())
